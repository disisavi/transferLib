#Transfers Lib 
## Spotify => Google Services

This is a commandline (as of now) which will transfer your spotify lib to your YT music lib.
In future I might have the will power to convert it into a fully fleshed web app with lots of customisation etc, but that day is not today. 
Right now its **going** to be a command line flask app which will do exactly what the Heading says.
